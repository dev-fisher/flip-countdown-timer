# Flip Countdown Timer with Reset Animation (Vanilla JS)

This is an animation Flip Countdown Timer in Vanilla JavaScript.

When triggered, the counter will have a cool 1 second reset animation, and then will start the countdown to the end time.

To trigger the countdown from JS, simply invoke the triggerCountdown(endTimeValue) function in script.js. 

endTimeValue - must be a time value in the future (maximum 100 days from now).
